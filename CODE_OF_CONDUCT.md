# Code of Conduct for participating in Abraxas VOTING

## Introduction

The cantons in Switzerland are responsible for conducting ballots on the federal and cantonal (state) level and for tallying the votes. They use electronic systems for managing the ballots (ballot administration, configuration, and communication between the canton and the municipalities) and for aggregating the results tallied in the municipalities.

The two cantons St. Gallen and Thurgau commissioned Abraxas Informatik AG (`Abraxas`) to develop a new software (`Ergebnisermittlungssystem` with the product name `VOTING Ausmittlung` hereafter `System`). This software shall be subject to public scrutiny prior to its release: Abraxas publishs a pre version (release candidate) of the System containing information about the software and the infrastructure, its source code and the corresponding documentation, and conducts a Bug Bounty Program. Those measures combined are referred to as "**The Program**" hereafter.

The goal of the Program is to find and fix security issues and to improve the quality of the System. The cantons and Abraxas firmly believe that openness and public scrutiny will lead to a trustworthy System of high quality.

This Code of Conduct and the [Bug Bounty Policy](./SECURITY.md#bug-bounty-policy) together establish the rules for the Program. The [Bug Bounty Policy](./SECURITY.md#bug-bounty-policy) on the Bug Bounty Platform is synonymous to the Security Policy on GitHub.

## Roadmap

The Program is staged. In the first stage, which started on Monday, 23rd May 2022, access was provided by invitation only and it was initially limited to specific parts of the System. In the different stages more participants received access, and more aspects of the System have become accessible. Please note that in a normal, productive setting the System is not exposed to the Internet.

### May 2022

- Private Bug Bounty Program, by invitation only. Included access to some parts of the source code and the pertinent information.

### May until August 2022

- An increased audience got access and additional parts of the source code and the pertinent information were released. This phase is now closed.

### August 2022

- Step-by-step public release of the source code and the pertinent information
- Public Bug Bounty Program

We will from time to time as considered necessary issue an updated version of this Code of Conduct.

## Basic Rules

Scope of the Program is the disclosed material and the dedicated System for the Bug Bounty Program (as defined in chapter "Scope"). Any other information, services and systems are out of scope.

Abraxas retains all intellectual property and relates rights to the source code and other disclosed components of the System, including copyright and patent rights. No transfer of title is intended.

Everyone accessing all or part of the Program or participating in the public security test or the Bug Bounty Program agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Code of Conduct and the [Bug Bounty Policy](./SECURITY.md#bug-bounty-policy).

Abraxas runs the Bug Bounty Program with support from Bug Bounty Switzerland GmbH. The decisions in the Bug Bounty Program are made by Abraxas solely.

## What you can expect from us

- We carefully review all incoming reports about vulnerabilities and are interested in a constructive dialog on an equal footing.
- We recognize reports from experts as an important contribution to the improvement of the security of the System / "Ergebnisermittlungsystem" (`VOTING Ausmittlung`).
- We pay fair rewards in the Bug Bounty Program.
- We respect the academic freedom of researchers.

## What we expect from you

- Participants respect the privacy and property of others and avoid destroying data or disrupting systems.
- Participants report their findings to Abraxas through one of the offered channels.
- Participants read the Code of Conduct and adhere to it, including responsible disclosure

## Participation Rules

No registration is required for accessing the System and its source code, once disclosed publicly. However, you need to register if you want to participate in the Bug Bounty Program to:

- conduct active security tests on the System
- get accounts on the System
- be eligible to get rewards for valid vulnerabilities

You may register for the Bug Bounty Program on the [Bug Bounty Switzerland Plattform](https://www.bugbounty.ch/abraxas-public-trust-programm/).

## Scope

In scope for the Program is information about the software and the infrastructure, its source code and the corresponding documentation available on GitHub.
In scope for the Bug Bounty Program is a dedicated non-productive instance of the running product `VOTING Ausmittlung`, including the necessary infrastructure. The product `VOTING Ausmittlung` and its infrastructure include for example:

- `VOTING Ausmittlung` (Backend)
- `VOTING Ausmittlung` Erfassung (Frontend)
- `VOTING Ausmittlung Monitoring` (Frontend)
- `VOTING Basis` (Backend & Frontend)
- `VOTING IAM` (Identity and Access Management)

Please note that in a normal, productive setting `VOTING Ausmittlung` is not exposed to the Internet.

For more information about the technical details of the scope, how to access the System and the [Bug Bounty Policy](./SECURITY.md#bug-bounty-policy) please refer to the [Abraxas Bug Bounty Program Page](https://www.bugbounty.ch/abraxas-public-trust-programm/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/abraxas-labs/).

## Submission Guidelines

Findings need to be reported through one of the following channels:

- Bug Bounty Program on the [Bug Bounty Switzerland Plattform](https://www.bugbounty.ch/hacker/?application_to_program=Abraxas)
- issue / security advisory to the Abraxas Product Security Incident Response Team: psirt-voting@abraxas.ch

    Please ensure to report only findings having an impact on security of the product `VOTING Ausmittlung` (see chapter "Scope"). Your report must contain a clear proof of concept that demonstrates the scenario. Findings which have no impact on security or which are purely theoretical are not eligible.

Your submission must contain the following details:

- Attack scenario including impact on the product `VOTING Ausmittlung` in form of a step-by-step procedure to reproduce the issue
- References to the documentation and the source code:
  - implicated protocols/algorithms
  - implicated pages/paragraphs
  - implicated line(s) of code (when relevant)
  - any other information that might help us identify the vulnerable parts
- External references:
  - Academic references on the matter
  - Technical studies on the matter
  - Conference papers
  - Any other information that might help us understand the vulnerability

### Rewards

For legal reasons, rewards can only be obtained through the Bug Bounty Program. Rewards are distributed at the discretion of Abraxas. Reporting a finding does not mean you have a right to bug bounty bonuses.

## Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure

Abraxas will communicate transparently about results and findings as soon as the public release starts on GitHub under [voting-ausmittlung-docs / Security Advisory](https://github.com/abraxas-labs/voting-ausmittlung-docs/security/advisories).

Everyone who reports a relevant finding will be credited for it in accordance with the terms of the [Bug Bounty Policy](./SECURITY.md#bug-bounty-policy). If you wish, you may remain anonymous. You may also use an alias.

You are free to publish your findings only after allowing Abraxas a maximum of 90 days (starting from the day of your submission) to analyze your submission and the opportunity to fix the vulnerability. Coordinated disclosure with Abraxas after 90 days would be appreciated, but is not specifically required.

## License Source Code (Permitted use)

You are entitled to examine and modify the source code for non-commercial or non-productive purposes. You may publish papers on your findings and use the information gained for the purpose of research, advancing knowledge, teaching or learning.

You are allowed to make copies of the source code. The license terms, copyright notices and attributions included in the source code or the other materials must be maintained and adhered to at all times.

You are not allowed to use any part of the Program, or any information gained from the Program or from parts of the Program for commercial purposes or for any use in another system or for any productive use. In particular, the source code or any part of it may not be used in any software or for any goods or services.
